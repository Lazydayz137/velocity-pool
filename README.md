# Velocity Pool üöÄ

A high-performance, multi-currency mining pool with **one-click VPS deployment** and focus on CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant coins. Built on .NET 6.0 with optimized native libraries for maximum performance.

## ‚ö° Quick Deploy

Deploy your entire mining pool infrastructure in under 30 minutes:

```bash
# On your Ubuntu VPS
wget -O deploy-vps.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lazydayz137/velocity-pool/master/deployment/deploy-vps.sh
chmod +x deploy-vps.sh
./deploy-vps.sh your-domain.com
```

## üéØ Strategic Coin Focus

Velocity Pool targets profitable opportunities for new mining operations:

- **Verus (VRSC)** - VerusHash algorithm (CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant) ‚úÖ
- **Monero (XMR)** - RandomX algorithm (CPU-only, privacy-focused)
- **Ergo (ERG)** - Autolykos algorithm (GPU-friendly, emerging)
- **Raptoreum (RTM)** - GhostRider algorithm (CPU-only, ASIC-resistant)

*Why these coins? They avoid ASIC dominance, have active communities, and offer growth potential for new pool operators.*

### Features

- Supports clusters of pools each running individual currencies
- Ultra-low-latency, multi-threaded Stratum implementation using asynchronous I/O
- Adaptive share difficulty ("vardiff")
- PoW validation (hashing) using native code for maximum performance
- Session management for purging DDoS/flood initiated zombie workers
- Payment processing with multiple schemes (PPLNS, PROP, SOLO)
- Banning System with DDoS/flood protection
- Live Stats API on Port 4000
- WebSocket streaming of notable events like Blocks found, Blocks unlocked, Payments and more
- POW (proof-of-work) & POS (proof-of-stake) support
- Detailed per-pool logging to console & filesystem
- Docker containerization support
- Runs on Linux and Windows
