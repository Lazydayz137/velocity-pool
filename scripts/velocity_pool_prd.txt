# Velocity Pool - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Velocity Pool is a high-performance, multi-currency mining pool software built on .NET 6.0, based on the Miningcore framework. The project aims to provide ultra-low-latency Stratum protocol implementation supporting both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining for multiple cryptocurrency families including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero (CryptoNote), Equihash-based coins, and Ergo.

## Current Status
The project is actively developed with a comprehensive codebase featuring:
- Modular blockchain family implementations
- Asynchronous Stratum server with variable difficulty
- Payment processing with multiple schemes (PPLNS, PROP, SOLO)
- PostgreSQL persistence with optimized partitioning
- RESTful API with WebSocket streaming
- Native performance libraries for hashing algorithms

1. **Kaspa kHeavyHash** - Implement support for high-volume DAG-based mining
2. **YescryptR32** - Add CPU-friendly ASIC-resistant algorithm
3. **X25X SINOVATE** - Implement multi-algorithm approach for SINOVATE network
4. **Mobile Dashboard Enhancement** - Extend PWA capabilities with offline mining statistics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 months)

#### Enterprise Features (Priority: Medium)
1. **Flux EquihashX** - Implement Equihash variant for Flux network support
2. **Alephium Blake3** - Add specialized Blake3 implementation for sharded blockchain support
3. **ML Analytics** - Implement machine learning-based predictive pool optimization
4. **Multi-tenant Pools** - Develop enterprise white-label solution architecture

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Load Time**: < 2 seconds for dashboard initialization

- **Algorithm Coverage**: 50+ cryptocurrency variants supported
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target with zero memory leaks
- **Mobile Compatibility**: 100% responsive design across all device types

### Architecture Requirements
- Maintain existing modular .NET 6.0 architecture
- Preserve PostgreSQL optimization with table partitioning
- Ensure compatibility with existing native hashing libraries
- Support Docker containerization for deployment
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing pool configurations

### Development Standards
- Follow existing coding patterns from WARP.md documentation
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Use established CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Maintain API compatibility for existing mining clients
- Document all new features in existing documentation structure

### Security Requirements
- Implement DDoS/flood protection for new algorithms
- Maintain secure payment processing mechanisms
- Ensure proper session management for mining connections
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Follow established security practices for cryptocurrency operations

## Success Metrics
- Successful deployment of all Phase 1 features within 2-4 week timeline
- Achievement of performance targets for dashboard and real-time updates
- Successful integration of 4 new mining algorithms in Phase 1
- Positive user feedback on new dashboard functionality
- Measurable improvement in mining pool efficiency and user experience

## Dependencies
- .NET 6.0 SDK and runtime environment
- PostgreSQL 11+ for optimal partitioning support
- Node.js and npm for frontend development
- Native development libraries (boost, sodium, OpenSSL)
- Existing mining daemon integrations for supported cryptocurrencies

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Algorithm Integration Risk**: Thorough testing with testnet configurations before mainnet deployment
